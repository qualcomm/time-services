autoreconf --install
./configure --with_qmi_prefix <absolute path to qmi-framework>
make

By default, ```./configure``` command will configure the project to install compiled libraries and
binaires in system's  ```/usr/bin``` directory.
To install libraries and binaries in custom directory, you can specify the directory by passing
```--prefix``` flag.
For example: ```./configure --with-qmif-prefix=<absolute path to qmi-framework> --prefix=$(pwd)/install```

Alternatively, you can also run the below script, passing the required compiler as an argument:
```sh
./build_script.sh --with_qmi_prefix <absolute path to qmi-framework>
```
For, ARM based targets:
```sh
./build_script.sh --host aarch64-linux-gnu --with_qmi_prefix <absolute path to qmi-framework>
```
